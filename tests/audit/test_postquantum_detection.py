"""The study's central claim is a negative. This is what makes it sayable.

"No post-quantum signatures were found in any ecosystem" is only worth stating
if the detector could have produced a positive. Before this, it could not:
`cryptography` rejects a certificate whose SubjectPublicKeyInfo carries an
algorithm OID it does not implement, at LOAD time, so `public_key()` was never
reached and the "this may be a post-quantum key" branch below it was
unreachable for the case it was written for. `SigAlgorithm.ML_DSA_87` existed in
the model and no code path could return it.

The first real post-quantum attestation in any registry would have been filed
as "certificate does not parse" and counted with corrupt data.
