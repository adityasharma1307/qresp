"""The registry is the single source, and the derived views agree with it.

These tests exist because the three tables this file replaced had already
drifted: `slh-dsa-128f` was bindable by the combiner, unimplemented by the
backend factory, and absent from the policy registry, so one algorithm got
three different answers depending on which module was asked. Structural tests
are the only thing that keeps that from happening again -- nobody notices
divergence by reading.
