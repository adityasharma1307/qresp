"""liboqs against NIST's ACVP key material, and the limit of what that can show.

WHY THE ACVP VECTORS CANNOT SIMPLY BE REPLAYED THROUGH liboqs
=============================================================
The FIPS 204 vectors in `fips204_vectors/` are **internal-interface**: the
group objects carry no `signatureInterface`, and `test_fips204_acvp.py`
exercises them through `_sign_internal` / `_verify_internal`. FIPS 204's
external `ML-DSA.Sign` prepends a domain separator and the context string to
the message before calling the internal routine, so a signature valid under one
interface is invalid under the other **by construction**.

liboqs-python exposes only the external API. Replaying internal vectors through
it would therefore fail, and the failure would say nothing about liboqs. Three
things follow, and the third is the useful one:

* **sigVer vectors: unusable.** Wrong interface.
* **sigGen vectors: unusable.** They pin byte-exact output for a supplied `rnd`,
  and liboqs signs in hedged mode with no way to inject it.
* **keyGen vectors: usable, and they close a real gap.** They give NIST-derived
  `(sk, pk)` pairs. Loading a foreign secret key into liboqs and signing with it
  exercises the key-import path -- which the cross-validation tests never touch,
  since there liboqs signs only with keys it generated itself. A private-key
  encoding mismatch would be invisible to every other test in this repository.

This is the scope stated exactly, rather than a claim of "validated against
FIPS 204 KATs" that would be true of the pure-Python backend and not of this
one.
