"""Adversarial tests for RFC 3161 upper-bound time evidence.

WHAT THESE CAN AND CANNOT COVER, STATED UP FRONT
================================================
Producing a *valid* timestamp response requires a TSA: it is CMS SignedData
signed by an authority's key. This suite cannot mint one, so it cannot assert
"a good token verifies" from first principles. Claiming otherwise would be the
kind of test that passes because it never exercised the thing it names.

What it does cover is every path where a wrong answer is dangerous:

  * a token that does not verify must not produce evidence
  * a token over DIFFERENT bytes must not verify against this signature
  * an empty trust store must fail closed, not open
  * duplicates must not satisfy an independence threshold
  * unavailability must be distinguishable from forgery
  * unverified claims in a bundle must not mint trusted evidence

The one gap -- a genuine end-to-end rescue against a real public TSA -- needs a
network round trip, and becomes a committed fixture the moment a real response
is obtained. Until then this file says so rather than implying coverage it
does not have.
