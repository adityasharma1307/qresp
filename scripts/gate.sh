# The full gate, with exit codes that actually propagate.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
# Every gate run in this project was written as `python -m pytest -q | tail -2`.
# A pipeline's exit status is the status of its LAST command, so `tail` succeeding
# masked pytest failing. A commit went out with a failing test and the gate
# reported success, because the only thing checked was whether `tail` worked.
#
# Runs everything, reports each result, exits non-zero if any failed.
