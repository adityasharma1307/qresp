"""Measure the ML-DSA timing side channel, and show that noise does not close it.

This produces the evidence cited in docs/THREAT-MODEL.md. It exists so the
claim "random delay is not a countermeasure" is a measurement in this
repository rather than a citation to folklore.

TWO EXPERIMENTS
===============
1. **The leak.** Sign repeatedly with one key, then with another, and compare
   the distributions. ML-DSA uses rejection sampling, so the iteration count --
   and therefore the duration -- depends on secret key material.

2. **Whether noise helps.** Add uniform random delay and ask how many traces an
   attacker needs to tell the two keys apart by comparing mean durations.
   Averaging suppresses zero-mean noise as 1/sqrt(N) while the secret-dependent
   signal stays fixed, so accuracy should climb with trace count regardless of
   how much noise is added. If it does, noise injection is a speed bump rather
   than a countermeasure.
