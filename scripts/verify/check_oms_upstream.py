"""Detect whether OpenSSF has changed the OMS spec under us.

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============
This project reports three gaps in OMS v1.0:

  1. `signature` is closed to new fields and `keyid` is explicitly not used for
     verification, so a bundle can carry an ML-DSA signature that no verifier
     can identify. Hybrid verification is structurally possible and
     semantically undefined.
  2. The hash enums (`serialization.hash_type`, `resources[].algorithm`) admit
     only sha256/blake2b/blake3. No SHA-3, so per-file digests cannot use a
     hash with margin against Grover.
  3. The algorithm registry names no post-quantum algorithm at all.

Every one of those is a claim about a *living document*. OpenSSF may close any
of them tomorrow, and if they do, three things in this project become wrong at
once: the spec proposal, the paper's motivation, and the compatibility tests
that assert OMS rejects what we need.

Discovering that from a reviewer is the bad outcome. This script fetches the
live spec, compares it to what we vendored, and says plainly what changed.

WHAT IT CHECKS
==============
  * byte-level drift in each vendored schema and in the registry
  * whether the three specific gaps above are still open
  * whether the registry has gained any post-quantum entry

EXIT CODES
==========
    0   no drift; the vendored copies still match upstream
    1   drift detected; read the report and update the paper
    2   could not reach upstream; nothing was checked

Exit 2 is deliberately distinct from 0. "I could not check" and "I checked and
all is well" are different states, and conflating them is how a stale claim
survives into a submission.
