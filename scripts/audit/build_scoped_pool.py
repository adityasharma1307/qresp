"""Stage 1, rebuilt: a scoped candidate pool from what popular packages depend on.

    python scripts/audit/build_scoped_pool.py \
        --ranking data/npm_ranking_unscoped.json --top 20000 \
        --out data/npm_scoped_candidates.txt

WHY THE SEARCH-BASED POOL WAS REPLACED
======================================
The first stage 1 swept npm's search API with letter and digram seeds. It
failed, and not by a little: **25 of 30 unmistakably top-tier packages were
absent** from the resulting pool -- lodash, chalk, debug, express, webpack,
eslint, @types/node, @babel/core among them. The pool's 10,000th-ranked package
had 157 downloads/month, which is not a head at all.

Two causes, both fatal:

1. `--target` stopped the sweep as soon as enough distinct names had been
   collected, at request ~1,400 of 2,848 -- partway through the seed list. Only
   seeds `a`..`ma` ever ran, which is also why the survivors skewed alphabetically.
2. More fundamentally, **npm search does not rank by downloads**. Probed
   directly: `text=lo&popularity=1.0` returns `lo`, `lodash._objecttypes`,
   `lodash._shimkeys`, `lodash._basebind` -- deprecated micro-packages -- and
   never returns `lodash` itself. It prefix-matches names and scores by a blend
   that popularity weighting does not dominate. Fixing the early stop would not
   have fixed this; the source was wrong.

WHAT REPLACES IT
================
Unscoped packages no longer need a pool at all: npm's bulk endpoint takes 128
names per request, so all ~2.69M unscoped names can be ranked exhaustively for
~21,000 requests (`rank_npm.py --frame`). Exact, not approximate.

Only scoped packages still need one, because they must be queried individually.
This script derives it from **the dependencies of the top-ranked unscoped
packages**: a scoped package that matters is, with few exceptions, one that
popular packages depend on. That is a genuine popularity signal rather than a
name-matching artefact, it uses only `registry.npmjs.org` (which tolerates a far
higher rate than the downloads API), and it is exactly reproducible from a
pinned ranking file.

The same rule as before still applies and is what makes this sound: stage 1 does
not rank. `rank_npm.py` measures real downloads over whatever comes out of here.
Stage 1 only has to avoid *losing* popular scoped packages.

RESIDUAL CAVEAT FOR THE PAPER
=============================
A scoped package with high download counts that no popular unscoped package
depends on -- a widely installed CLI or application scope, say -- would be
missed. Direct-dependency reach is a proxy for popularity, not popularity
itself. This is a stated limitation rather than a hidden one, and it is
bounded: the head it feeds is checked against the measured download threshold,
so the effect of any miss is visible as a gap in coverage rather than as a
silently wrong ranking.

        These were the same value in the first version, both reported as "seeds
        with no readable dependency list" -- which conflates the most ordinary
        thing on npm with a collection failure. Popular packages very often
        have ZERO dependencies: ms, picocolors, is-number and most of the
        micro-package layer. A seed with no deps contributes nothing and is
        fine. A seed that could not be fetched means candidates are MISSING
        from the pool, and only the second is a reason to distrust the result.

        The same absent-versus-unchecked rule the scanners enforce, which this
        script was violating while sitting two directories away from them.
