"""Sanity-check a ranking before anything is built on it.

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============
The first npm ranking looked entirely plausible and was badly wrong: 7,139
packages, a sensible-looking top 20, and 25 of 30 unmistakably top-tier packages
missing. Nothing about the file announced the problem. The second pool was wrong
for a different reason -- npm search returns `lodash._objecttypes` but not
`lodash` -- and again the output looked fine.

A ranking that omits `lodash` is not a ranking of npm, and that is cheap to
check and expensive to discover later. So this checks it explicitly, exits
non-zero when it fails, and prints the distribution that makes a hollow pool
obvious.

It also accepts a partial file, so a long run can be checked while in flight.
