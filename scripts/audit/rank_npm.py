"""Stage 2 of the npm head ranking: real download counts over a candidate pool.

    python scripts/audit/rank_npm.py --candidates data/npm_candidates.txt \
                                     --out data/npm_ranking_2026-07-30.json

WHY THIS IS TWO STAGES AND NOT ONE
==================================
npm publishes no downloads ranking, and its bulk downloads endpoint **rejects
scoped packages**. `@babel/*`, `@types/*` and similar are a large share of the
most popular names -- 37.4% of the whole namespace is scoped -- so ranking only
what the bulk endpoint accepts would bias the head towards unscoped packages
rather than towards popular ones. A candidate pool comes in (stage 1), and this
script measures real downloads over it: bulk for unscoped, individually for
scoped.

THE 429 STORM, AND WHAT IT TAUGHT
=================================
The first run of this script had no throttle and no retry. api.npmjs.org is far
stricter than registry.npmjs.org, and it began returning HTTP 429 at roughly
batch 49 of 239. The damage was not merely that 42,965 of 50,104 candidates
went unmeasured. It was that **the survivors were alphabetically biased**:
because the candidate pool is sorted, the batches that completed before the
rate limit engaged were the early-alphabet ones, so 84% of measured names began
with a, b or c, and only 228 of 19,527 scoped packages measured at all.

An incomplete ranking would have been merely weak. A ranking whose losses
correlate with the sort order is *worse than a random subsample*, because the
bias is invisible in the output -- the file looks like a clean ranking of 7,139
packages. Nothing in it says "this is the top of the alphabet, not the top of
npm."

Three changes follow from that:

* **Throttle** to a fixed request rate rather than firing as fast as possible.
* **Retry with exponential backoff**, so a 429 delays a batch instead of
  destroying it.
* **Persist partial results** after every batch, so an interrupted or
  rate-limited run resumes instead of restarting -- the same lesson the entropy
  collection and the PyPI scanner already learned.

And one that is about honesty rather than mechanism: the run **fails loudly**
if too large a share of candidates went unmeasured, rather than writing a
plausible-looking ranking built from whatever survived.

WHAT STAGE 1 HAS TO GET RIGHT, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
===================================================
The candidate source does not need to rank well; stage 2 ranks. Stage 1 only
has to avoid *losing* genuinely popular packages, so it errs large.

Residual caveat for the paper, one sentence: a package with very high downloads
and near-zero presence in the candidate source would be missed. That is an edge
case rather than a systematic bias -- unlike ranking a random subsample, where
a 2.9% sample would miss ~97% of the true top 10,000 because sampling
probability is independent of popularity.

    The first throttled version paced requests but let each thread back off
    privately. That does not work: while one worker sleeps 32s on a 429, the
    other three keep issuing requests at the full rate, so the server sees no
    reduction and the 429s continue indefinitely. Backoff has to be a property
    of the shared pace, not of the individual request.

    So a 429 does two things here: it pauses *every* worker until the stated
    (or estimated) retry time, and it multiplicatively widens the interval for
    all future requests. Successes narrow it back gradually. This is ordinary
    AIMD congestion control, which is what a rate limit calls for.

        produces six near-simultaneous 429s. Widening on each of them treats one
