"""Draw the Stratum B (long-tail) sample for the QKnot stratified audit.

METHODS SUMMARY
===============
The audit uses a two-stratum design over the HuggingFace model registry:

    Stratum A (head): the top 10,000 models by all-time download count.
    Stratum B (tail): 10,000 models drawn uniformly at random from every
                      model *outside* Stratum A.

Stratum B is a genuine random sample, not "the next 10,000 by downloads".
That distinction is the whole point of the design. Ranks 10,001-20,000 are
still popular models and would tell us about the head a second time; a
uniform draw from the remaining population is what licenses inference about
the registry as a whole, and it is what makes the head-versus-tail contrast
the paper's actual finding rather than a comparison of two shades of popular.

The HuggingFace API offers no random-sample endpoint, so a uniform draw
requires a sampling frame. This script builds one:

    1. ENUMERATE. Page through `GET /api/models` sorted by `createdAt` to
       collect the id of every model in the registry. Sorting by creation
       date (rather than by downloads) gives a stable, append-only ordering:
       new models enter at one end and never reshuffle the rest, so a frame
       built over several hours is not corrupted by models moving between
       pages mid-enumeration. Sorting by downloads would have exactly that
       defect, because download counts change continuously.

    2. EXCLUDE. Remove every id in Stratum A, so the two strata are disjoint
       and the weighted combination in stats.py is valid.

    3. DRAW. Take `random.sample(frame, 10_000)` from a `random.Random`
       seeded with an explicit, logged integer.

The frame itself is written to disk alongside the sample. This is deliberate.
A seed alone does not make the draw reproducible, because the population it
was drawn from changes daily as models are added and removed. Publishing the
frame lets a reviewer re-run the draw and get byte-identical output, and lets
them check the draw was uniform rather than taking our word for it.

REPRODUCIBILITY
===============
Every run writes a manifest recording the seed, the frame size, the exclusion
count, the API snapshot time, and a SHA-256 of the frame file. Re-running with
the same `--seed` against the same `--frame` reproduces the sample exactly.

    # full run: enumerate, then draw
    python scripts/sample_longtail.py --head-ids data/head_10k.jsonl --seed 20260725

    # re-draw from a published frame without touching the network
    python scripts/sample_longtail.py --frame data/longtail_frame_2026-07-25.txt \
        --head-ids data/head_10k.jsonl --seed 20260725

COST
====
Enumeration is the expensive phase: it touches the entire registry, not just
the 10,000 models we keep. At 1,000 ids per page this is roughly one request
per thousand models in the registry. See --estimate-only to measure the
population size and projected request count before committing to a full run.
