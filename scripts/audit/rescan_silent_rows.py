"""Re-scan the rows whose provenance the current parsers would now record.

WHY THESE ROWS AND NOT THE WHOLE DATASET
========================================
Two groups of rows are stale, for two different reasons, and both are standing
warnings in `scripts/verify/redteam_check.py`:

  1. **Silent rows.** Rows carrying a resolved `sig_algorithm` and no note at
     all. They were scanned before the parsers emitted positive provenance
     (`parsed_from_openpgp_packet`, `parsed_from_spki_oid`), so the dataset
     cannot say *how* those algorithms were determined. The classification is
     almost certainly right -- these were direct parses, which is why they have
     no "inferred" note -- but "probably right and unable to say why" is not a
     claim a paper should rest on.

  2. **Gated repositories.** Repos that returned HTTP 401 because access is
     restricted. These are only worth retrying if you now hold a token with
     access; without one they will fail again identically, which is itself a
     result worth recording rather than a reason not to run.

Re-scanning everything would be simpler and wrong: it would rewrite 20,000 rows
against a live registry that has moved on, silently mixing two scan dates into
one dataset. That exact mistake -- a July file quietly replacing a May one at
the same filename -- is documented in docs/DATASETS.md as the reason every
output here is date-stamped.

WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT DO
============================
It does not modify the published datasets. It writes a *separate* rescan file
and prints a comparison. Merging is a second, deliberate step (see --merge),
because a re-scan that silently overwrote the audit would destroy the ability
to show that the two agree.

USAGE
=====
    # 1. see what would be re-scanned, without touching the network
    python scripts/audit/rescan_silent_rows.py --dry-run

    # 2. re-scan (needs HF_TOKEN for the gated repos to have any chance)
    python scripts/audit/rescan_silent_rows.py --token $env:HF_TOKEN

    # 3. compare, then merge only if the labels agree
    python scripts/audit/rescan_silent_rows.py --merge
