"""Assert every number in BENCHMARKS.md still matches the results JSON.

WHY THIS EXISTS
===============
BENCHMARKS.md was written by transcribing figures out of `results/*.json` by
hand. Twice during that transcription a search-and-replace silently failed to
match, leaving a stale number in prose that read as authoritative. Nothing
caught it: the file is Markdown, so it always "builds", and the wrong figure
looks exactly like the right one.

A benchmark document whose numbers have drifted from the run that produced them
is worse than no benchmark document, because it invites a reviewer to cite a
figure the artefacts do not support. This script re-derives every claim from the
JSON and fails loudly on any mismatch.

    python scripts/bench/check_docs.py

Exit codes:
    0  every checked figure matches
    1  at least one figure has drifted
    2  could not check -- a results file or an expected passage is missing

Note 2 is distinct from 1 on purpose. "The numbers are right" and "I could not
find the numbers" must never be reported the same way; a checker that returns
success when it checked nothing is the failure mode it is meant to prevent.
