WHY A GENERATOR RATHER THAN AN EDITED .ipynb
============================================
A notebook is JSON with source split into arrays of strings. Editing one by hand
means fighting escaping, and a diff of a hand-edited notebook is unreadable --
outputs, execution counts and metadata churn alongside the actual change. Here
the cells are plain Python strings, the diff is the text, and the notebook is a
build artefact that can be regenerated and re-executed.

    python scripts/demo/build_notebook.py          # write the notebook
    python scripts/demo/build_notebook.py --run    # write, then execute it

Task 7 of the Phase II memo. Decisions taken 2026-07-27:

  * signs `openai/privacy-filter` -- the one signed openai repo in the head
    stratum, already Sigstore/ECDSA-P256, so the demo shows a classical
    signature and a hybrid one over the same artefact;
  * the typosquat scenario uses a **synthetic** attacker built in the notebook.
    The registry does contain lookalike names, but they appear to be legitimate
    derivative work and naming them would assert bad faith on no evidence;
  * entropy is the NIST beacon (no API key, works in Colab) plus the system
    CSPRNG, which is exactly the split `mix_entropy` enforces;
  * signing is deterministic so a reader re-running the notebook gets identical
    bytes. Production signing is hedged; the notebook says so.

# QKnot — quantum-resilient provenance, end to end

**Phase II demo notebook.**

This notebook signs a **real HuggingFace model** with a non-separable hybrid
signature, verifies it, and then attacks it five different ways to show what the
construction does and does not protect.

It runs in Colab with no API keys and no hardware.

## What the audit found, in one line

Of **20,000** HuggingFace repositories surveyed (a census of the top 10,000 by
downloads plus a uniform random sample of 10,000 from the remaining 2.9M):

| | signed | post-quantum |
|---|---|---|
| head stratum | 39 / 10,000 | **0** |
| long tail | 10 / 10,000 | **0** |

Every signature found is breakable by Shor's algorithm. `openai/privacy-filter`
— the artefact this notebook signs — is one of the 39, and its signature is
**ECDSA P-256**.

So the demo is not hypothetical. It takes a model that is signed today with a
classically-secure scheme and shows what signing it for the post-quantum
transition looks like instead.

## 1. The artefact, and the signature it already has

`openai/privacy-filter` carries a `model.sig` — a Sigstore bundle. Our audit
classified it `vulnerable` because Sigstore's Fulcio default is ECDSA P-256.

Downloading the full model is slow in Colab, so `LIGHT = True` fetches the
configuration, tokenizer and signature files only. **The manifest records
exactly what was signed either way**, so nothing is misrepresented — the
notebook prints the file list it actually covered.

## 2. Entropy, with evidence rather than assertion

A key seeded from a quantum source and one seeded from `os.urandom` are
indistinguishable by inspection — both are 32 uniform-looking bytes. So a claim
of quantum provenance is unfalsifiable unless something is recorded.

Two kinds of source, and conflating them is catastrophic:

- **secret** (`os.urandom`, a QRNG) — provides *unpredictability*
- **public** (the NIST randomness beacon) — provides *verifiability* and a
  *timestamp*, and **no unpredictability whatsoever**, because everyone can read it

The beacon is therefore mixed in as the HKDF **salt**, never as key material.
`mix_entropy` raises if the only sources available are public — a hard error,
because a key derived from public values alone is computable by anyone.

## 3. Sign it

Two algorithms, one artefact:

- **Ed25519** — what verifiers can check *today*. Shor-breakable.
- **ML-DSA-44** (FIPS 204) — what survives a quantum adversary.

Both sign the DSSE pre-authentication encoding of the same in-toto statement,
which contains a **binding** committing to the *set* of algorithms in use. That
is what makes the pair inseparable, and section 5 attacks it.

`deterministic=True` makes the notebook reproducible: re-run it and you get
identical signature bytes. Production signing is **hedged** — FIPS 204 mixes 32
fresh random bytes per signature to frustrate fault-injection attacks — and the
bundle records which mode produced it.

## 5. The same thing, from a terminal

Everything above used the Python API, which is the wrong shape for the person
this tool is actually for: someone with a model directory and a release to cut.
`qknot sign` and `qknot verify` are that interface.

The cells below run the real commands through `subprocess` so the output is
genuine rather than transcribed, and so they work identically on Windows, macOS
and Linux. After `pip install -e .` the invocation is simply `qknot sign ...`.

Unlike the API section above, `qknot sign` is not given a seed, so it draws
entropy live. **If you see a line like `Entropy source anu unavailable: ANU
returned HTTP 500`, that is the design working, not a failure.** A source went
down, `mix_entropy` skipped it, signing continued on the sources that remained,
and the reason was written into the attestation. The alternative -- silently
substituting and claiming provenance that was never established -- is the thing
this project exists to avoid.

The entropy attestation and backend descriptors travel inside the envelope. An
earlier revision signed only the binding, so those fields *looked* signed and
were freely editable — an attacker could set `sideChannelResistant: true` on a
backend that is not, or delete the note recording a PRNG fallback.

Signatures now cover the DSSE PAE of the whole statement.

### 6.5 The temporal boundary — verifying in 2031

Once an algorithm breaks, an attacker forges a signature *and claims it is old*.
Every old signature under that algorithm becomes indistinguishable from a fresh
forgery. So a signature does not decay because it is old; it decays because new
forgeries become equally plausible.

Here is the same bundle, verified with the clock moved past Ed25519's 2030

**The gap this exposes, and the reason for the spec proposal.** OMS `signature`
objects are `additionalProperties: false`, and the specification says `keyid`
"is not used for verification". So a conformant OMS bundle can *carry* an ML-DSA
signature that no verifier can *identify*.

OMS can transport a hybrid signature and cannot describe one. That is what the
algorithm binding works around, and what the proposal to OpenSSF asks them to
fix.

## 8. Why any of this matters: the substitution scenario

A user runs `from_pretrained("openai/privacy-filter")`. What stops them running
a different artefact under a name they trust?

Today, for 99.9% of the registry: nothing. Nothing is signed, so there is
nothing to check.

Below, an attacker publishes a lookalike. **This is synthetic** — built in this
notebook, under a name nobody owns. The registry does contain repositories with
similar names, and they appear to be legitimate derivative work; naming them
here would assert bad faith on no evidence.

**Read that second result carefully.** A QKnot bundle proves integrity,
algorithm non-separability and covered provenance metadata *relative to a public
key you already trust*. It does **not** establish that the expected party signed.

That is a trust-anchor problem, not a signature-format one, and it is out of
scope for `sign`/`verify` alone by design. QKnot's answer lives in a separate
mechanism, identity registration: `qknot register` binds a post-quantum key to
your OIDC identity through a classical Fulcio certificate and a Rekor log
entry, and `qknot verify --registration` reports not just that a signature is
valid but *whose* it is and on what basis. See `docs/REGISTRATION-SPEC.md`
for the design and the honest residuals -- the binding is only as strong as
the identity that anchored it, stated plainly rather than glossed over.

## Summary

| Attack | Result |
|---|---|
| modify a signed file | rejected |
| add an unsigned `.pyc` to `__pycache__` | rejected |
| strip the ML-DSA signature | rejected in STRICT; accepted in CLASSICAL, with warnings |
| strip **and** rewrite the declared suite | rejected |
| forge the entropy attestation or backend claims | rejected |
| present a classical-only signature in 2031 | critical finding; hybrid unaffected |
| substitute the artefact under a trusted bundle | rejected |
| re-sign with the attacker's own keys | **accepted — identity is out of scope** |

**What this demonstrates.** A hybrid signature is not two signatures side by
side. Placed side by side it is broken by deleting a field. Binding the
algorithm set into what both algorithms sign is what makes it hold, and the
binding fits inside an unmodified OMS bundle.

**What it does not.** Identity binding, and whether the signer's own claims
about their entropy were true. Both are stated in `docs/THREAT-MODEL.md` rather
than papered over.
