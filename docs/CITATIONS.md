# Citations and source integration

Every claim below was verified against the primary source, not against a
summary. Line numbers refer to extracted text of each PDF and are given so the
check can be repeated rather than taken on trust.

**The PDFs are not committed.** They live locally under `docs/sources/`
(gitignored): 33 MB of binaries made every commit slow over a mounted
filesystem, and a citation record needs stable identifiers, not bytes. This
file is therefore the interim record and will be **superseded by
`references.bib` with DOIs**, at which point each entry below should carry its
DOI and the line references become redundant.

Until then, reproducing a check means re-obtaining the PDF named in each
section and extracting its text; filenames are given throughout for that
purpose.

LaTeX comes later; this is the staging document. Prior writeup for context:
`docs/report.pdf`.

## 1. Governance and regulation

### 1.1 The three tiers must not be blended

The single most common error available here is quoting one date as "the"
post-quantum deadline. There are three regimes, they cover different systems,
and they give different dates.

| regime | applies to | signature deadline | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CNSA 2.0** | National Security Systems only | 2027-01-01 exclusive use, software/firmware signing | final |
| **EO 14412 / OMB M-26-15** | civilian federal HVAs, high-impact systems | **2031-12-31** | final memorandum |
| **NIST IR 8547** | technical timeline both reference | 2030 deprecated / 2035 disallowed | **Initial Public Draft** |

**M-26-15 explicitly excludes national security systems** — ✅ line 21:

> "This memorandum does not apply to national security systems."

So CNSA 2.0 and M-26-15 are disjoint in scope. A sentence implying one
timeline governs both is wrong.

### 1.2 The operative civilian date for this project is 2031, not 2030

QKnot is a signing tool, so Phase 4 governs it, not Phase 3.

✅ line 274:

> "Phase 3 (Prioritized Migration – 2028 - 2030): The prioritized migration
> phase should migrate to the use of PQC **for key establishment** all HVAs,
> high impact systems…"

✅ line 318:

> "Phase 4 (**Signature Migration – 2031**): The signature migration phase
> should migrate to the use of PQC **for digital signatures** all HVAs, high
> impact systems, systems with highly sensitive data… Ensure that all systems
> are cryptographically agile."

✅ line 323 — a fifth phase the task memo did not mention, worth having:

> "Phase 5 (Full Migration – 2035): The final phase should focus on completing
> the migration of remaining systems…"

The 2030 date at line 98 is the *overall* objective — "mitigating as much
quantum risk as feasible by December 31, 2030" — not a signature deadline.
Citing it as one conflates Phase 3 with Phase 4.

**Note the last clause of Phase 4: "Ensure that all systems are
cryptographically agile."** That is an explicit federal requirement for the
property `algorithms.py` implements, and it is a stronger hook for the
governance chapter than the deadline itself.

### 1.3 IR 8547 is a draft, and OMB hedges on it

✅ line 540, footnote 14:

> "For more information, see NIST IR 8547, available at
> `https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/ir/8547/ipd`."

The `/ipd` suffix is Initial Public Draft. ✅ line 326 shows OMB itself
hedging — "align their plans with NIST Internal Report (IR) 8547" — and the
memo's own phrasing elsewhere admits no successor exists yet. Cite as a draft
everywhere.

### 1.4 M-26-15 describes exactly this project's architecture — with a caveat that must travel with it

✅ lines 535-537, verbatim:

> "**For Digital Signatures:** A hybrid signature involves creating two
> distinct signatures on the same data—one with a traditional algorithm and
> one with a PQC algorithm. The verifier…"

✅ lines 522-529:

> "A hybrid architecture is an implementation model that combines a traditional
> cryptographic algorithm, such as ECDH or ECDSA, with a PQC algorithm, such as
> FIPS 203 ML-KEM or FIPS 204 ML-DSA. Compromising the security of the
> operation requires an attacker to break both the classical and the PQC
> schemes if properly implemented."

⚠️ **The task memo asked to cite this as "strong, direct governance
validation." The same paragraph continues, and it does not read as
endorsement** — ✅ lines 527-529:

> "…however, because it introduces its own risks and complexities, agencies
> considering this approach should perform a thorough evaluation of its
> tradeoffs, as it is **an intricate and resource-intensive stopgap**."

Quoting the first half without the second is selective, and a reviewer
checking the source will find it immediately. The honest framing, which is
still favourable:

> OMB M-26-15 describes precisely this construction — two distinct signatures
> over the same data, both validated — while characterising hybrid deployment
> as an intricate and resource-intensive stopgap requiring per-agency tradeoff
> evaluation. QKnot's measurements speak directly to that tradeoff: §3 of
> RESULTS.md quantifies the cost as 64 bytes and 0.28 ms over ML-DSA alone,
> which is the evaluation the memorandum asks agencies to perform.

That turns the caveat into the paper's opening rather than something to hide
from.

## 2. Physical security and timing (`THREAT-MODEL.md`)

### 2.1 Azouaoui (NXP) — ML-DSA physical security

Source is a slide deck: *"Recent Contributions to the Physical Security of
ML-DSA"*, Melissa Azouaoui, NXP PQC Team, © 2024. ✅ title verified page 1.

Use for the leakage-resistance argument and for the "we rely on liboqs rather
than hand-rolling constant-time code" position: real hardened ML-DSA
implementations are specialised, ongoing engineering work.

⚠️ **Do not cite fault-injection/DFA material as corroborating this project's
timing finding.** The deck covers both side-channel *and* fault injection
(✅ line 255 "Fault Attacks (FA)"), and they are different threat categories.
QKnot observes passive timing variance on a software implementation; DFA is
active fault injection on embedded hardware. Cite DFA only if a
fault-injection subsection is added to the threat model.

**✅ The underlying papers are now supplied and identified.** Exact titles —
the task memo's short forms were close but not citable as written:

| memo short form | actual title | file |
|---|---|---|
| "Protecting Dilithium against Leakage (TCHES 2023)" | **Protecting Dilithium against Leakage — Revisited: Sensitivity Analysis and Improved Implementations**, Azouaoui, Bronchain, Cassiers, Hoffmann, Kuzovkova, Renes, Schneider et al. | `2022-1406.pdf` |
| "Bronchain et al. (TCHES 2024)" | **Exploiting Small-Norm Polynomial Multiplication with Physical Attacks: Application to CRYSTALS-Dilithium**, Bronchain, Azouaoui, ElGhamrawy, Renes, Schneider (NXP) | `2023-1545.pdf` |
| — (not in memo) | **From MLWE to RLWE: A Differential Fault Attack on Randomized & Deterministic Dilithium**, TCHES 2023(4):262-286, DOI `10.46586/tches.v2023.i4.262-286` | `TCHES2023_4_11.pdf` |
| — | **A Generic Framework for Side-Channel Attacks against LWE-based Cryptosystems**, Hermelink, Streit, Mårtensson, Petri (MPI-SP) | `2024-1211.pdf` |
| — | **LWE with Side Information: Attacks and Concrete Security Estimation**, Dachman-Soled, Ducas, Gong, Rossi | `2020-292.pdf` |

⚠️ **`TCHES2023_4_11.pdf` is the DFA paper** — "Differential Fault Attack on
Randomized & Deterministic Dilithium". This is the ElGhamrawy material the task
memo correctly said must **not** be cited as validating this project's passive
timing finding. Now that it is in the repo, the temptation is greater, so the
boundary is restated: active fault injection on embedded hardware is a
different threat class from passive timing observation of a software
implementation.

Two supplied papers are **tangential** and should not be cited for the
signature threat model: `2025-812.pdf` (Post-Quantum Cryptography in eMRTDs —
travel documents, PAKE/PKI) and `TCHES2022_4_14.pdf` (Post-Quantum
Authenticated Encryption against Chosen-Ciphertext Side-Channel Attacks — KEM,
not signatures). Azouaoui is an author on both, which is presumably why they
travelled with the set.

❓ **Still missing:** the masked-implementation references (Migliore 2019,
Azouaoui 2022, Coron 2023/2024) named in the task memo for the
"why we rely on liboqs rather than hand-rolled hardening" argument. Not among
the uploads.

### 2.2 Systematic Timing Leakage Analysis — the scope boundary is the point

Source: *"PQDSS Candidates: Tooling and Lessons Learned"* (✅ page 1), a slide
deck on the NIST **additional signatures** round.

⚠️ **ML-DSA is not in this study.** Verified by count in both the deck and
the full paper: `dilithium` and `ml-dsa` appear **0 times**. The 15 primitives
are NIST **additional-signatures** (PQDSS) candidates — SNOVA, Preon, LESS,
Mirath, PERK, UOV and others. **This paper says nothing about ML-DSA's
constant-time properties and must never be cited as if it does.**

**✅ Full paper now supplied**, resolving both open flags — and correcting
both. Adjonyo, Bardin, Bellini, Dione, Al Ameen, Merget, Recoules et al.,
*Systematic Timing Leakage Analysis of NIST PQDSS Candidates: Tooling and
Lessons Learned*.

**Scale**, ✅ lines 78-82:

> "Our method allowed us to analyze **302 instances of 15 primitives**… we
> reported the **26 most critical issues** to the respective authors, among
> which **5 have been already acknowledged as critical vulnerabilities and
> fixed** by their developers, namely the alerts from SNOVA and Preon from
> round 1 and LESS (2 alerts) and Mirath from round 2."

⚠️ **The task memo's "Binsec/Rel had 0% false positives across 22 alerts" is
not what the paper says.** Two errors: the count is **26 reported issues**, not
22, and the precision claim is qualified. ✅ lines 94-96, verbatim:

> "…faster, has better code coverage, and flags more issues, Binsec/Rel2
> achieves a much higher precision with respect to its constant-time policy. In
> particular, **on a small subset of benchmarks for which we manually checked**,
> Binsec/Rel2 always raises alerts that are actual constant-time violations,
> while **67% of TIMECOP alerts turned out not to be actual constant-time
> violations**."

So: Binsec/Rel2 raised no false positives *on a manually-checked subset*, and
the 67% figure is TIMECOP's false-positive rate, not Binsec's. Citable
sentence:

> Binsec/Rel2 raised no false positives on the subset the authors manually
> verified, against a 67% false-positive rate for TIMECOP.

Adopt `Binsec/Rel2` and `dudect` as named acceptance criteria for the liboqs
backend; `side_channel_resistant = True` must rest on measurement, not build
flags. ✅ toolchain published at `github.com/Crypto-TII/pqdss-ct-toolchain`.

**⚠️ The PERK framing in the task memo is not supported — but the paper gives
something better.** There is no PERK developer-response narrative; PERK appears
only as tested instances (✅ lines 395-404, one `!` on `perk-128-short-5`).
What the paper does contain is a *general methodological* finding, ✅ lines
257-262:

> "Another common source of irrelevant CT violations is found in algorithms
> using **rejection sampling**… This **inherently creates a variable execution
> time**, as a different number of sampling operations are performed based on a
> secret. **This variable execution time is usually not exploitable, as the
> secret is typically not used directly.**"

That is stronger than a single-candidate anecdote: it is the authors' general
position on rejection sampling, and it corroborates this project's own
reasoning about ML-DSA's 11.5× spread.

⚠️ **But cite it for the reasoning, not as a finding about ML-DSA** — ML-DSA is
not in the tested set (below). And note the direction of difference honestly:
the paper says such variance is *usually not exploitable*, whereas
`THREAT-MODEL.md` takes the more conservative line that it disqualifies the
pure-Python backend from online signing. QKnot is stricter than this source,
not supported by it. Saying so is better than implying agreement.

## 3. Crypto-agility examples (`RESULTS.md` §7)

### 3.1 Two HAWK results, independently sourced, must not be merged

✅ van Gent & Pulles (CWI), *"HAWK: Having Automorphisms Weakens Key"*,
lines 7-12:

> "…a nontrivial automorphism of the underlying integer lattice. Knowledge of
> such a nontrivial automorphism speeds up the key recovery attack on HAWK **at
> least quadratically, which would halve the number of security bits**. Luo et
> al. (ASIACRYPT 2024) recently found an automorphism that breaks omSVP…"

| | existing §7 entry | this paper |
|---|---|---|
| mechanism | unrelated | known nontrivial lattice automorphism, building on Luo et al. ASIACRYPT 2024 |
| shape | exponential reduction (~2⁶⁴ → ~2³⁸) | **quadratic** speedup, halves security bits |
| source | AI-system result, specific date | CWI academic paper |

⚠️ Both support "algorithm margin erodes faster than expected." **They are
different results and neither corroborates the other.** Present as two
independently-sourced instances, distinguished by citation and by mechanism.
Two independent examples is a stronger argument than one; conflating them
would be a factual error a HAWK-aware reviewer would catch instantly.

---

## 4. Fail-stop signatures — future work only

✅ Lines 17-21: the construction is `FSS.SPHINCS` — "SPHINCS+ (now
standardized as SLH-DSA) augmented with a fail-stop mechanism", developed via
Lamport signatures as the running example.

⚠️ **This does not resolve the classical-identity caveat and must not be
presented as doing so.** The mechanism depends on compressing hash functions
admitting multiple valid preimages — a property of hash-based chain
constructions (WOTS+/XMSS/FORS/SPHINCS+). It does not extend to discrete-log
schemes (Ed25519, ECDSA P-256 — this project's identity anchor) or to lattice
schemes (ML-DSA). Making it apply is new research.

Future Work wording:

> Detecting a classical-identity forgery in the wild — as opposed to bounding
> when it could have occurred — requires a fail-stop mechanism. These exist
> today for hash-based signatures (FSS.SPHINCS) but not for the discrete-log
> or lattice schemes this design depends on; constructing one is future work
> and is not attempted here.

### 4.1 Flame — the historical motivating example

✅ Lines 27-32:

> "Take the example of Flame [26], a malware that exploited forged Microsoft
> certificates… Flame was exploiting collisions on MD5 thanks to a forensic
> tool for collision attack to MD5. **But what if the research world had not
> caught up with the attack?**"

This is the Introduction's motivating example, and it is a better one than any
hypothetical: a real forged code-signing certificate, exploiting a break in an
algorithm that was already known to be weakening, undetected until independent
cryptanalysis caught up. It motivates the temporal-trust-boundary mechanism
directly — the question "when was this signed, relative to when the algorithm
fell?" is exactly what nobody could answer about Flame at the time.

## 4b. Measured: strict DER rules out most commercial TSAs

Not a citation but a measurement, recorded here because it is the kind of
concrete deployment fact a paper section on ecosystem friction can use.

Probed 2026-07-30, eight public RFC 3161 authorities, one request each
(`scripts/verify/probe_tsa.py`):

| authority | result |
|---|---|
| `tsa.swisssign.net` | ✅ parses |
| `ts.ssl.com` | ✅ parses |
| `freetsa.org/tsr` | ✅ parses |
| `timestamp.digicert.com` | ❌ non-canonical DER |
| `timestamp.apple.com/ts01` | ❌ non-canonical DER |
| `rfc3161.ai.moda` | ❌ non-canonical DER |
| `timestamp.sectigo.com` | connection reset |
| `timestamp.entrust.net` | connection reset |

**Three of eight — including DigiCert and Apple — emit a CMS
`SignedData::certificates` SET that is not sorted in DER order.** RFC 5652
types that field as a `SET OF`; DER requires the elements of a SET OF to be
sorted by encoding. `rfc3161-client` enforces this and rejects the whole
response with `InvalidSetOrdering`.

⚠️ **`sigstore-python` verifies with the same parser**, so this is not
peculiar to QKnot: a strict-DER verifier cannot consume timestamps from a large
share of the commercial TSA population, including two of the most widely
deployed. Worth stating carefully in the paper — the claim is *these responses
are not canonical DER*, not *these TSAs are broken*; they are widely trusted and
interoperate fine with lenient parsers.

The point for the paper is the gap itself: specification conformance and
deployed practice have diverged far enough that a correct verifier is the one
that struggles. Loosening the parser would trade a real property — that a
signed structure has exactly one valid encoding — for compatibility, which is
the trade this project exists to argue against.

## 5. Newly identified sources — related work, not requested

Four uploads were not in the task memo. Two are directly load-bearing.

### 5.1 Atlas (Intel Labs) — the closest related system ⚠️ read before submitting

✅ *"Atlas: A Framework for ML Lifecycle Provenance & Transparency"*,
Spoczynski, Melara, Szyller (Intel Labs), arXiv 2502.19567v2.

**Known to the author since early July; not yet integrated.** It remains the
nearest neighbour to QKnot and the highest-priority related-work gap. A USENIX
reviewer in ML supply chain will know it, so related work must state explicitly
what QKnot does that Atlas does not — on current evidence, direction-typed
temporal evidence and algorithm-lifetime rescue. **That differentiation claim
must be checked against Atlas's actual mechanisms before it is written**, not
asserted from the abstract.

### 5.2 Kalu et al. — industry interview study of software signing

✅ *"An Industry Interview Study of Software Signing for Supply Chain
Security"*, USENIX Security '25.

Same venue, adjacent topic, one cycle earlier. Two uses: qualitative evidence
for *why* signing adoption is low, complementing this project's quantitative
0.39%/0.10% measurement; and a venue-fit signal — USENIX has recently accepted
work on exactly this problem.

### 5.3 Wang et al. — backdooring merged models

✅ *"From Purity to Peril: Backdooring Merged Models From 'Harmless' Benign
Components"*, USENIX Security '25. Threat motivation: model merging composes
components whose provenance is unverified. Cite in the introduction for why
artifact-level provenance matters in ML specifically.

### 5.4 Poisoned Acoustics — marginal

*"Poisoned Acoustics: Targeted Data Poisoning Attacks on Acoustic Vehicle
Classification"* (Dahme, preprint). Data-poisoning threat, not supply-chain
provenance. Weak fit; include only if the introduction needs a second
poisoning example, and note it is a non-peer-reviewed preprint.

---

## 6. Open flags

1. **❓ Binsec/Rel false-positive figure and PERK case study** — not
   extractable from the slide deck; verify before writing.
2. **❓ The five TCHES/masking papers** — named in the task memo, not
   resolvable from the NXP deck. Fetch DOIs individually.
3. **⚠️ Atlas is uncited** and is the closest prior system. Highest-priority
   related-work gap.
4. **⚠️ M-26-15 calls hybrid a "stopgap."** Quote both halves.
5. **✅ Registry regime DECIDED (2026-07-30): M-26-15.** The classical
   entries must move from `2030-12-31` to **`2031-12-31`**, the Phase 4
   signature-migration deadline, since QKnot is a signing tool and Phase 3's
   2030 date governs key establishment. Pending change, not yet applied:

   | file:line | field | from | to |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | `algorithms.py:89` (`ed25519`) | `disallowed_after` | `2030-12-31` | `2031-12-31` |
   | `algorithms.py:100` (`ecdsa-p256`) | `disallowed_after` | `2030-12-31` | `2031-12-31` |
   | `algorithms.py:110` (`ecdsa-p384`) | `disallowed_after` | `2030-12-31` | `2031-12-31` |
   | `algorithms.py:118`, `:126` (RSA) | `disallowed_after` | `2030-12-31` | `2031-12-31` |
   | all classical entries | `source` | SP 800-131A Rev.2 | OMB M-26-15 Phase 4 (2026), implementing EO 14412 |
   | new field | `regime` | — | `omb-m-26-15` |

   The `regime` field stays, because the date is regime-dependent: an NSS
   deployment is on CNSA 2.0 (2027) and would need different data. Encoding
   one date with no statement of which regulation it comes from is what
   produced this ambiguity.

   **This feeds the rescue branch and now the registration-statement call
   site, so the value is load-bearing twice.** `test_algorithms.py` will need
   its date assertions updated in the same change.

6. **❓ Masked-implementation references still missing** — Migliore 2019,
   Coron 2023/2024, named in the task memo for the liboqs-over-hand-rolling
   argument, are not among the uploads.

## Related work: PQC library and tooling papers (added 2026-07-31)

### Shaw, *quantum-safe: Bridging the Post-Quantum Production Gap with a Hybrid-by-Default Python Cryptography Library* (arXiv, 2026)

**Overlap, stated plainly rather than minimised.** Shaw's Principle P1,
"hybrid by default", is the same design stance Phase II embodies. This should
be named directly in Related Work; a reviewer will find it, and understating it
reads worse than owning it.

**Where the contributions separate**, on reading rather than on the abstract:

| | Shaw | QKnot |
|---|---|---|
| empirical registry measurement | none | stratified HF/PyPI/npm adoption at scale |
| transparency logs / Rekor | not addressed | bound direction as a typed property |
| algorithm-deprecation rescue | not addressed | the core mechanism |
| entropy attestation | not addressed | keys bound to attested entropy |
| X.509 hybrid certs | Ounsworth composite-signatures draft, general PKI | OMS-compatible model-registry signing |

Shaw is a general-purpose library-and-benchmark contribution. There is no
audit of deployed artefacts in it, which is where this project's empirical
result lives.

**Cited critically, and the criticism narrowed after reading it.** The paper is
*more careful than a summary suggests*: immediately before the CoV discussion it
states CoV is "a necessary, not sufficient, condition for constant-time
behaviour", and Limitations says plainly that it "cannot distinguish variation
caused by secret-dependent branching from variation caused by cache effects on
public data", pointing at dudect and ct-verif. Characterising this as an
unhedged overclaim would be unfair, and the earlier draft of this entry did.

What remains, and it is narrower and sharper: the section asserts the variation
is **"Input-independent: The signing key does not influence how many rejection
iterations are needed."** That is a claim about the *key*, not only the
message, and it is stronger than the literature supports — ML-DSA's rejection
check is against the secret polynomials. This project's paired harness
separates **two keys on identical messages** at 10 traces each; if the
iteration count were key-independent, that result could not exist. See
`docs/THREAT-MODEL.md`, which quotes the passage rather than paraphrasing it.

**Corroboration worth citing, not just contesting:** Shaw's environment section
pins **liboqs 0.15.0** built with `-DOQS_DIST_BUILD=ON`, and reports 4.9%
throughput degradation at 5,000 concurrent users, "confirming that liboqs
releases the Python GIL during C-level operations". Independent support for the
Task D backend choice, and a useful fact if concurrent signing is ever
benchmarked here.

### Shaw, *Quantum-Safe Auditor (QSA)* (arXiv:2604.00560, preprint)

Full title: *Quantum-Safe Code Auditing: **LLM-Assisted** Static Analysis and
Quantum-Aware Risk Scoring for Post-Quantum Cryptography Migration* — the
LLM-assisted element is central and belongs in any characterisation of it.

Three stages: regex detection of 15 classes of quantum-vulnerable primitive,
LLM-assisted contextual enrichment for usage and severity, then risk scoring
via a Variational Quantum Eigensolver in Qiskit 2.x with qubit-cost estimates.

**The figures, stated precisely:** 71.98% precision, 100% recall, F1 83.71% —
on a **stratified sample of 602 labelled instances** drawn from 5,775 findings
across five libraries (python-rsa, python-ecdsa, python-jose,
node-jsonwebtoken, Bouncy Castle Java). Not a CVE dataset, and the sample is
the unit the figures describe, which is worth stating accurately since 100%
recall on a stratified subsample is a different claim from 100% recall on the
full corpus.

**Complementary, not competing, and the distinction is the unit of analysis:**
QSA audits *source code* for crypto that will break; QKnot audits *deployed
signed artefacts* in registries for signatures that will break. A project could
score perfectly under QSA and still publish classically-signed releases — which
is the gap this study measures.

### Incidental corroboration for the liboqs backend choice

Both papers use liboqs as their reference backend (Shaw pins 0.15.0), which is
mild independent support for the choice recorded in
[`THREAT-MODEL.md`](THREAT-MODEL.md) ("liboqs, measured"). Shaw also
notes liboqs releases the GIL during C-level operations — potentially useful if
concurrent benchmarking ever matters here, not pursued now.

### pyca/cryptography timeline — resolved

* ML-DSA **raw signing**: version 49.0.0 (2026-06-12), requiring AWS-LC/BoringSSL
  or OpenSSL 3.5.0+ for the official wheels.
* ML-DSA **X.509 loading**: exact release not pinned from changelog text.
  Resolved empirically instead — `mlDsaCertificatesIssuable` measured **false**
  on 48.0.0 and **true** on 49.0.0, same day, two machines.
* **SLH-DSA: still unsupported**, per Trail of Bits (2026-06-30): "SLH-DSA is
  not supported in pyca/cryptography 48, but we've started working on it." No
  timeline. The defensive OID fallback therefore stays necessary regardless of
  ML-DSA progress.

## Related work: Atlas (Spoczynski et al., Intel Labs, arXiv:2502.19567v2)

The closest prior system, and the one a reviewer will reach for first. Read in
full; the differentiation below is from the text, not from the abstract.

**What Atlas does.** A Rust library and CLI capturing artifact measurements,
**Intel TDX attestations** and digital signatures in **C2PA** format, with a
sidecar collector hooking PyTorch to record training events, committing to a
transparency log. It **extends Sigstore's Rekor** to accept C2PA-based model
transformation attestations. The contribution is end-to-end lineage across the
ML lifecycle, with metadata integrity rooted in trusted hardware.

**The axes are orthogonal, and this is the sentence for the paper:** Atlas
establishes *what happened* across a pipeline and attests it with hardware;
QKnot establishes *that the attestation will still verify* once its signature
algorithm is deprecated. Atlas is about breadth of coverage; this work is about
durability of the evidence. Neither substitutes for the other.

**Measured, not asserted.** Searched the full text: `post-quantum`, `quantum`,
`ML-DSA`, `Dilithium`, `PQC`, `algorithm agility`, `crypto-agility`,
`deprecat*`, `expir*`, `rotation` — **zero occurrences of any of them.** Atlas
does not engage algorithm lifetime at all.

**Two specific interactions, stronger than generic differentiation:**

1. **Atlas extends Rekor, and Rekor is where this project found the structural
   gap.** Rekor v2 supports only `hashedrekord`, which requires an externalised
   prehash; ML-DSA has no defined prehash. Atlas's own transparency substrate
   therefore has no post-quantum path today — a limitation it inherits rather
   than one it introduces, and one it does not discuss because algorithm
   lifetime is outside its scope. That is a concrete, citable relationship
   between the two systems.

2. **Atlas's threat model explicitly trusts the transparency and verification
   services** ("model users, transparency and verification services are trusted
   in Atlas"), placing MLaaS providers, hubs and artefact producers outside the
   trust boundary. QKnot's temporal work operates precisely on what remains
   provable when time evidence must itself be evaluated — bound direction as a
   typed property. Different trust boundary, so different mechanism.

**One claim to verify before submission:** Intel TDX/SGX DCAP attestation quotes
are signed with ECDSA P-256, which would make Atlas's hardware root of trust
quantum-vulnerable on the same timeline as the signatures above it. This is
well established but is **not stated in the Atlas paper**, so cite the Intel
DCAP specification directly rather than inferring it, and phrase it as an
observation about the attestation ecosystem rather than a criticism of Atlas.
