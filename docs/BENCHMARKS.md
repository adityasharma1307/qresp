# Benchmarks

Task 8 of the Phase II memo. Three questions:

1. What does hybrid signing cost?
2. How does that cost scale with the size of a real model?
3. Do the entropy sources behave the way the pipeline assumes?

**Measured 2026-07-30** on Windows 11, CPython 3.13.14, `--reps 250`, hybrid
and scaling at `ml-dsa-87` (the shipped default). Full machine details are
recorded in `results/bench.json` alongside every figure. §5's entropy results
are from the 2026-07-28 collection and are unaffected by the signing
configuration.

Regenerate with:

```bash
python scripts/bench/latency.py --reps 50 --sizes 1 10 100 --out results/bench.json
python scripts/bench/collect_entropy.py --source all
python scripts/bench/randomness.py --out results/randomness.json
python scripts/bench/check_docs.py     # every figure below, re-derived from the JSON
```

The last command is not optional bookkeeping. Every number in this document was
transcribed by hand out of `results/*.json`, and during that transcription two
search-and-replace operations silently failed to match, leaving stale figures in
prose that read as authoritative. `check_docs.py` re-derives all 115 of them and
exits non-zero on any disagreement; `pytest tests/bench` runs it, including a
test that deliberately corrupts a figure to confirm the checker can still fail.
Exit code 2 means *could not check* and is reported separately from exit 1,
*checked and wrong* — a verifier that cannot tell those apart is the failure it
exists to prevent.

## 1. Primitives

Median of 250 repetitions, **each over a different message**. That detail is not
incidental — see "The trap in benchmarking ML-DSA" below.

| algorithm | keygen | sign | verify | signature | public key | secret key |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ed25519 | 0.055 ms | **0.088 ms** | 0.134 ms | **64 B** | 32 B | 32 B |
| ML-DSA-44 | 3.635 ms | 16.198 ms | 4.371 ms | 2,420 B | 1,312 B | 2,560 B |
| ML-DSA-65 | 6.001 ms | 27.878 ms | 6.695 ms | 3,309 B | 1,952 B | 4,032 B |
| **ML-DSA-87** | **9.318 ms** | **33.845 ms** | **10.202 ms** | **4,627 B** | 2,592 B | 4,896 B |

**ML-DSA-87 is the shipped default**, reversing an earlier bandwidth-driven
choice of ML-DSA-44 (the smallest parameter set meeting the security target).
The reversal is CNSA 2.0: it names ML-DSA-87 specifically and requires
exclusive use for software/firmware signing in US National Security Systems
from 2027-01-01 — inside the lifetime of any artefact signed now. A
provenance system whose default fails the compliance regime its users are
migrating toward has chosen the wrong default, however efficient that default
is. -44 and -65 remain fully supported and selectable via `--suite` for
deployments where signature size dominates and CNSA 2.0 does not apply.

So ML-DSA-87 is the row that matters: **Ed25519 signs 383× faster and
produces a signature 72.3× smaller.** That is the headline cost of CNSA 2.0
alignment, and it is not a small one.

Two qualifications, both cutting the same way:

- **This is pure Python.** `dilithium-py` is a readable reference
  implementation, not an optimised one. liboqs' C implementation is one to two
  orders of magnitude faster. Nothing here is the cost of ML-DSA; it is the cost
  of *this* implementation.
- **Ed25519 here is OpenSSL.** Optimised C against interpreted Python, so the
  383× ratio flatters the classical side considerably.

### Signing time varies by up to sixteen-fold

| algorithm | sign p25 | median | p75 | max/min |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ed25519 | 0.088 ms | 0.088 ms | 0.089 ms | 1.2× |
| ML-DSA-44 | 12.068 ms | 16.198 ms | 24.066 ms | **16.0×** |
| ML-DSA-65 | 17.935 ms | 27.878 ms | 45.803 ms | **10.0×** |
| ML-DSA-87 | 24.810 ms | 33.845 ms | 50.993 ms | **8.0×** |

**Ed25519's 1.2× spread is the control.** A constant-time implementation over a
fixed-size input should show almost none, and it doesn't — so the machine was
quiet and the harness measures what it claims to. Against that baseline, the
ML-DSA spreads cannot be attributed to system noise.

ML-DSA signing rejects candidate signatures until one falls within bounds, and
the number of attempts depends on the key and the message. It is the same
secret-dependent variation that makes this backend unsuitable for an online
signing service — see [`THREAT-MODEL.md`](THREAT-MODEL.md). Reporting a mean
would hide it.

**This variance is large enough to break the parameter-set ladder at low
repetition counts.** An earlier run at `--reps 50` produced an ML-DSA-65 median
*above* ML-DSA-87 — physically impossible, since the larger set does strictly
more work — at 0.13 standard errors, i.e. pure noise. `check_invariants` now
emits a note when the sign ladder inverts, precisely because the published
table is what a reviewer reads. The figures above are from `--reps 250`, where
the ladder holds: 16.2 < 27.9 < 33.8 ms.

## 2. Scaling with artefact size

| artefact | digest | total sign | signature only | digest share | throughput |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 MiB | 3.9 ms | 39.1 ms | 35.2 ms | 10.1% | 253 MB/s |
| 10 MiB | 21.8 ms | 56.2 ms | 34.4 ms | 38.8% | 459 MB/s |
| 100 MiB | 213.9 ms | 250.0 ms | 36.1 ms | **85.6%** | 468 MB/s |

**The signature cost is flat — 34-36 ms at every size, a 1.05× spread — while
the digest grows linearly.** That is the whole result in one line, and it is a
property of the construction rather than of the machine: you sign a digest, so
the artefact's size cannot reach the signature. Throughput climbs with size as
per-call overhead amortises, settling around 468 MB/s.

Extrapolating from the 100 MiB throughput:

| model | digest | signature | signature share |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 GB | 2.2 s | 0.036 s | 1.62% |
| **7 GB** | **15.3 s** | **0.036 s** | **0.235%** |
| 70 GB | 153.3 s | 0.036 s | 0.024% |

For any artefact worth signing, the cost is the hash, not the cryptography —
and the share *falls* as models grow. The objection that post-quantum
signatures are too slow is true of the primitive in isolation and false of the
operation anyone actually performs.

---

## 3. Hybrid overhead

Over a 1 MiB artefact, so the digest is common to all three rows. **Measured at
`ed25519+ml-dsa-87`, the shipped default** — the parameter set is recorded in
`results/bench.json` as `hybrid_overhead.hybrid_level`, so this table cannot be
silently reinterpreted as describing a configuration it did not measure.

| configuration | sign | verify | signature bytes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ed25519 only | 3.25 ms | 3.10 ms | 64 |
| **hybrid** | **37.26 ms** | **13.61 ms** | **4,691** |
| ML-DSA-87 only | 36.95 ms | 13.44 ms | 4,627 |

Adopting the hybrid over Ed25519 alone costs **34.0 ms (11.5×) and 4,627
bytes**.

The more useful comparison is the third row: **the hybrid costs only 0.31 ms
more than ML-DSA alone**, and exactly 64 bytes more. Once you are paying for a
post-quantum signature, the Ed25519 half — and therefore backward compatibility
with every verifier that exists today — is essentially free. That is the
strongest practical argument for the hybrid over a straight ML-DSA migration.

### The result replicates across parameter sets

This measurement was made independently at two parameter sets, on different
days:

| | ML-DSA-44 (2026-07-28) | ML-DSA-87 (2026-07-30) |
|---|---|---|
| hybrid − ML-DSA alone, time | +0.28 ms | **+0.31 ms** |
| hybrid − ML-DSA alone, bytes | +64 B | **+64 B** |

The byte figure is exact and could not differ — an Ed25519 signature is 64
bytes by definition. The *time* agreeing to within 0.03 ms across a run where
the ML-DSA half more than doubled in cost is the informative part: the cost of
the classical half is independent of the post-quantum parameter set, which is
what makes "backward compatibility is nearly free" a structural claim rather
than a fact about one configuration.

The ordering is checked automatically: the hybrid computes the ML-DSA signature
*and* an Ed25519 one, so it cannot be faster than either component.
`latency.py` asserts this, along with the parameter-set ladder and the
specification's fixed signature sizes, and refuses to report results that
violate them.

---

## 4. End-to-end CLI

| | median |
|---|---|
| interpreter startup (`python -c pass`) | 55.2 ms |
| `qknot sign` | 302.7 ms |
| `qknot verify` | 244.5 ms |

Startup is 18% of an invocation; the rest is import time for `cryptography`,
`dilithium-py` and the CLI framework. Note that **`qknot sign` on a 1 MiB
artefact takes 303 ms against 37 ms for the same work through the API** —
roughly 88% of a one-shot invocation is process and import overhead, not
signing. Anyone signing a thousand artefacts should loop inside one process.

---

## 5. Entropy sources

### What these tests can and cannot establish

**They cannot validate an entropy source.** SP 800-90B assesses a *raw noise
source*, and every sample available here is conditioned:

| source | what it returns |
|---|---|
| `os.urandom` | CSPRNG output, seeded from the OS pool |
| ANU | post-processed detector counts, not raw measurements |
| NIST beacon | the output of a hash chain |

A good hash produces output indistinguishable from random regardless of how much
entropy went into it, so a high score is guaranteed and says nothing about the
physics. What these tests *can* do is catch gross failure — a stuck source, a
truncated transfer, a transport that returned the same block twice. For a
pipeline that fetches randomness over HTTP from two third parties, that is a
genuinely useful smoke test, and it is the only claim made here.

### Sample sizes, and why the beacon is awkward

SP 800-22 wants ≥10⁶ bits per sequence, ideally 100 sequences.

| source | per fetch | fetches for 10⁶ bits | wall clock |
|---|---|---|---|
| ANU | 8,192 bits | 123 | minutes |
| beacon (live) | 512 bits | 1,954 | **32.6 hours** |
| beacon (history) | 512 bits | 1,954 | ~30 minutes |

Live beacon collection is infeasible: the full 100-sequence suite would need 136
days of output that does not exist yet. The beacon's history is retrievable by
pulse index, so the same bits can be had in half an hour — and every pulse index
is recorded, so a reader can re-fetch any of them and confirm the sample was not
fabricated. That verifiability is the beacon's whole purpose.

**One sequence per source, not 100.** The arithmetic above is why.

### Results

All three sources at a full 10⁶ bits, against a deliberately broken control.
p-values, α = 0.01:

| source | monobit | freq. block | runs | cusum fwd | cusum bwd | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ANU QRNG | 0.084 | 0.098 | 0.030 | 0.091 | 0.111 | 5/5 ✓ |
| NIST beacon | 0.919 | 0.526 | 0.412 | 0.254 | 0.308 | 5/5 ✓ |
| `os.urandom` | 0.488 | 0.365 | 0.493 | 0.374 | 0.366 | 5/5 ✓ |
| repeating block (control) | 0.879 | **0.000** | 0.949 | 1.000 | 1.000 | 4/5 ✗ |

Min-entropy, SP 800-90B Most Common Value estimate:

| source | H∞ per bit | H∞ per byte | χ² p | uniform? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ANU QRNG | 0.9938 | 7.6584 | 0.249 | yes |
| NIST beacon | 0.9961 | 7.6535 | 0.598 | yes |
| `os.urandom` | 0.9953 | 7.6758 | 0.792 | yes |
| repeating block (control) | **0.9961** | **7.8392** | **1.000** | yes |

**The three real sources are statistically indistinguishable.** A quantum
optical source, a hash-chained government beacon, and a software CSPRNG all land
within 0.002 of each other per bit. That is the expected result, and it is worth
stating as the finding it is: **these tests cannot tell the sources apart,
because all three are conditioned output.** Anyone reading the ANU row as
evidence of quantum provenance has misread it.

ANU's `runs` p-value of **0.030** is the lowest figure in the table. It passes
at α = 0.01 and would fail at α = 0.05. With twenty p-values in the table, one
low value is unremarkable — but reporting it rather than rounding past it is the
point of showing p-values instead of ticks.

### The control is the most instructive row

**The deliberately broken source scores *higher* min-entropy than all three real
sources, and passes chi-square with p = 1.000.** A repeating block of bytes
0–255 has a perfectly uniform histogram and zero actual entropy.

That is not a defect in the estimator — it is what MCV measures. MCV looks at
the frequency of the most common symbol; chi-square looks at the histogram.
Neither looks at *order*. A counter is maximally uniform and completely
predictable.

Only `frequency_within_block` catches it, and only because the structure is
visible within a 128-bit window. Three of the five tests wave it through, and
both entropy estimates rank it top.

Two things follow, and both belong in the write-up:

1. **A min-entropy number without a structural test beside it is worse than no
   number**, because it looks like evidence.
2. **This subset is thin.** One test out of five catching the control is a
   narrow margin. The full fifteen-test battery would catch it several ways
   over; see below for why that was not available.

### Collection notes

Both public services failed repeatedly during collection, which is why the
collector retries:

- **ANU** returned HTTP 500 on the unauthenticated endpoint, then HTTP 429
  (rate limit) after ~100 requests with a key, then completed on a later run
  with three more transient failures absorbed by the retry logic. Final sample:
  125,000 bytes over 21 requests plus earlier resumed data.
- **The NIST beacon** dropped the connection twice mid-collection. Retries
  recovered both. Final sample: 125,000 bytes from chain 2, pulses
  1,878,255–1,879,296, every index recorded in the manifest so a reader can
  re-fetch and confirm.

### Only one of these samples is verifiable

The beacon manifest records every pulse index and its `output_value`, so a
reader can re-fetch those pulses from NIST and confirm byte-for-byte that the
sample is what it claims to be. **The ANU sample has no such property.** It is
125,000 bytes that this project asserts came from a quantum source; the service
publishes no retrievable record, so the assertion is unfalsifiable.

That is not a criticism of ANU — it is the difference between a randomness
*service* and a randomness *beacon*, and it is the same distinction the
provenance argument in this project turns on. A value you cannot independently
re-derive is a value you are trusting someone about. Both samples are committed
under `data/entropy/` with their manifests so a reader can at least confirm the
analysis was run over the bytes shown, but only the beacon supports the
stronger claim.

An earlier version of the collector abandoned the run on the first error and
lost 99% and 53% of the two samples respectively. Free public services return
500s and reset connections as a matter of course; a collector that treats that
as fatal never completes.

---

## 6. Why the SP 800-22 battery here is four tests, not fifteen

The obvious approach is an existing implementation. `nistrng` was tried and
abandoned after three defects surfaced in an afternoon, each of which would have
put a wrong number in the tables above:

1. **Cumulative sums overflowed.** The ±1 random walk was accumulated in the
   `int8` array its packing function returns, wrapping at 127. On 100,000 bits
   the correct max |S_k| was **724**; computing it raised **2,021 overflow
   warnings** and returned `passed=True, score=0.9994` from wrapped arithmetic.

2. **A passing p-value was reported as a failure.** Random Excursion returned
   0.683 — far above any sensible α — and was flagged failed.

3. **Results were inverted on structured input.** Non-Overlapping Template
   Matching scored `os.urandom` at 0.0 and the repeating block at 0.34, exactly
   backwards.

It reported `os.urandom` as failing **four of ten** tests. A suite that cannot
recognise the system CSPRNG cannot support a claim about anything else.

So [`src/qknot/signing/entropy/sp800_22.py`](../src/qknot/signing/entropy/sp800_22.py)
implements four tests — monobit, frequency within block, runs, cumulative sums —
each validated in `tests/signing/test_sp800_22.py`. Three reproduce the worked
examples printed in SP 800-22 Rev. 1a to six decimal places. The fourth
(cumulative sums) did not match the recalled constant, so rather than trust
either the implementation or the recollection, it is validated against the
empirical tail probability of 20,000 simulated random walks — agreeing to within
0.006 and converging in the tail where the α = 0.01 decision is made.

**Four verified tests are worth more than fifteen unverified ones.** The eleven
not implemented are listed in the JSON output so the gap is explicit.

This is also a finding in its own right: a widely available Python
implementation of a NIST statistical suite produces confidently wrong results,
and nothing about its output signals that.

---

## The trap in benchmarking ML-DSA

Worth recording because the first version of the harness fell into it and
produced an **impossible** result: the hybrid appeared four times *faster* than
ML-DSA alone, which cannot be, since the hybrid computes that same signature and
an Ed25519 one besides.

The cause: in deterministic mode, ML-DSA's rejection-sampling iteration count is
a fixed function of (key, message). Signing one fixed message a thousand times
performs the identical computation a thousand times — it measures how lucky that
message was, not what the algorithm costs. The luck is large; one key over eight
messages:

```
10.2  10.6  15.4  20.1  20.7  35.0  38.4  57.7  ms        5.7x spread
```

The hybrid and ML-DSA-only configurations sign *different* payloads, because the
algorithm binding differs and so the statement differs. The ML-DSA-only payload
drew an unlucky one.

`measure()` now passes the repetition index to the callable and every benchmark
varies its input with it, so what is reported is a sample of the distribution
over messages. Anyone benchmarking a rejection-sampling signature scheme should
check this first.

---

## Reproducing

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python scripts/bench/latency.py --reps 50 --sizes 1 10 100 --out results/bench.json
python scripts/bench/collect_entropy.py --source all --bits 1000000
python scripts/bench/randomness.py --out results/randomness.json
pytest tests/signing/test_sp800_22.py -q      # 32 tests validating the statistics
```

`latency.py` records the platform, CPU, Python version and library versions
alongside every result, and exits non-zero if any physical invariant fails.
