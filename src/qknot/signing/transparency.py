"""Upper-bound time evidence: RFC 3161 timestamps over a signature.

WHY A TIMESTAMP AUTHORITY AND NOT REKOR
=======================================
`temporal.py` can rescue a signature whose algorithm was later disallowed, but
only given an UPPER bound -- evidence the signature *already existed* at time T.
Nothing in a bundle provides that on its own, so until now the rescue branch was
unreachable from any real artefact.

The obvious source is a transparency log. It is not usable here, and the reason
is worth stating because it is a finding rather than an inconvenience:

  * Rekor v2 supports only the `hashedrekord` entry type, whose digest is taken
    over an externalised prehash (rekor-v2-spec 6.1.4).
  * ML-DSA has no externalised prehash in Sigstore's algorithm registry, so a
    post-quantum signature cannot be logged at all.
  * Fulcio will not certify an ML-DSA key either.

The deployed transparency ecosystem has no post-quantum path. That is precisely
the gap this project documents, so building on it was never an option.

An RFC 3161 Time-Stamp Authority has none of those constraints: **it hashes
opaque bytes**. It never parses the signature, never learns the algorithm, and
never needs to recognise the key. `sigstore-python` relies on the same property
-- `_verify_signed_timestamp(tsr, bundle.signature)` passes raw signature bytes
-- so this is not a workaround invented here, it is the mechanism the ecosystem
already uses for exactly this purpose, and the one part of it that happens to be
algorithm-agnostic.

WHAT A TIMESTAMP DOES AND DOES NOT PROVE
========================================
It proves these bytes existed at time T. It says nothing about who made them,
whether the signer was authorised, or whether the artefact is what it claims to
be. It is time evidence and only time evidence, which is why it produces a
`TimeEvidence` with `Bound.UPPER` and nothing else.

It also gives no *discoverability*: a timestamp is evidence you hold and must
present, whereas a log entry is evidence a third party can go and find. For key
registration that difference matters and Rekor earns its complexity; for
rescuing an artefact signature it does not, because the verifier already has
the bundle in hand.

OFFLINE BY CONSTRUCTION
=======================
Obtaining a timestamp needs the network exactly once, at signing time.
Verification never does: `verify_timestamp` takes its trust input as an
argument and performs no I/O. Note that what it enforces is *pinning of the
TSA certificate*, not PKI path validation -- see that function's docstring,
which records what was measured rather than what the API name suggests.

A verifier that must reach a server to decide whether a signature is valid has
made availability a precondition of integrity, which is the wrong trade for an
air-gapped release pipeline -- and would make this project's own offline
verification claim false.

#
# Three of the eight -- including DigiCert and Apple -- emit a CMS
# `SignedData::certificates` SET that is not sorted in DER order. RFC 5652
# types that field as a `SET OF`, and DER requires the elements of a SET OF to
# be sorted by their encoding, so `rfc3161-client` rejects the response with
# `InvalidSetOrdering`. sigstore-python verifies with the same parser, so this
# is an ecosystem fact rather than anything peculiar to this project: strict
# DER parsing rules out a large part of the commercial TSA population.
#
# The response is NOT to relax the parser. Accepting non-canonical DER in a
# verification path is how signature-malleability bugs start: if two distinct
# byte strings are both accepted as the same structure, an attacker gains a
# degree of freedom in something meant to be exactly comparable.
#
# All three below are run by different organisations in different
# jurisdictions, which is what makes the threshold mean anything -- two
# endpoints belonging to one company are one source of trust wearing two hats.
# All three are listed rather than the required two so that one authority being
# down does not block signing; `establish_time` still requires
# VERIFIED_TIME_THRESHOLD of them to verify.

    Performs no I/O. The trust decision is an argument, so a verifier decides
    for itself whom it trusts rather than inheriting whatever the bundle
    asserts.

    WHAT IS ACTUALLY ENFORCED -- MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED
    ==================================================
    `tsa_certificate` is the security boundary. `rfc3161-client` requires the
    certificate embedded in the response to equal the one supplied here, and
    verifies the token's signature under that certificate's key over
    `message`. Pass a different leaf and verification fails.

    **`roots` and `intermediates` are NOT path-validated.** Verified against
    real tokens on 2026-07-30: a SwissSign response verified while an SSL.com
    CA was supplied as its root, with and without the correct intermediates.
    The library accepts the arguments and does not build a chain to them.

    So the property obtained is *certificate pinning*, not PKI path
    validation: "this token was signed by the key in exactly this certificate,
    over exactly these bytes". That is a sound basis for time evidence -- and
    for a fixed set of known authorities it is arguably the more predictable
    one, since it does not inherit the ambient trust store -- but it is a
    different claim from the one this docstring previously made, and callers
    must not assume a chain was checked.

    A caller wanting real path validation must do it separately, with
    `cryptography.x509.verification`, before trusting the leaf it passes here.
    `roots`/`intermediates` are still forwarded so behaviour tracks the
    library if it gains path validation later.

    `message` MUST be the bytes the caller independently expects to have been
    timestamped. This is the whole security property: a valid timestamp over
    *different* bytes is not evidence about this signature, and passing bytes
    taken from the same untrusted bundle would verify a token against itself.
