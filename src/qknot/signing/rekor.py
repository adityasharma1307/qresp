"""Transparency-log inclusion: step 6 of the registration verification, and the
source of the upper-bound time `T` the temporal rescue turns on.

This is the *verification* side. It does not SUBMIT to a live log -- that is the
network seam an operator wires to a vetted Rekor client -- but every byte it
consumes is the byte a real Rekor entry carries, and every signature it checks is
a signature Rekor actually produces. What an expert reviews here is what runs.

WHAT IS AUTHENTICATED, AND BY WHAT
==================================
A registration's trustworthy time is load-bearing: the whole temporal rescue
turns on `T`. So nothing here is trusted as a bare field; each claim is tied to a
signature by the log's own key:

  1. THE PRE-IMAGE. The digest is EXTRACTED FROM the entry body that is proven
     included (`hashedrekord_digest`), and must equal the registration's
     pre-image. It is not a free field the submitter can set -- an expert review
     found that a separate `body_sha256` let a real inclusion proof for an
     unrelated entry be rebound to any registration. The digest now comes from
     the same bytes whose inclusion is proven, so the two cannot be decoupled.

  2. THE ROOT. The Merkle root is NOT accepted as a field either. It is parsed
     out of the log's signed CHECKPOINT (Rekor's STH), whose signature is
     verified under the log key, and the inclusion proof must reconstruct THAT
     root -- the checkpoint's, not a submitted one. A signature over a note that
     names a different root, or an inclusion proof to a root the log never
     signed, both fail.

  3. THE TIME. `integratedTime` is NOT accepted as a field either. It is
     authenticated by the log's signed entry timestamp (the SET, Rekor's
     `inclusionPromise`), whose signature over `{body, integratedTime, logID,
     logIndex}` is verified under the log key. Since the rescue turns on `T`, a
     `T` the log never signed would be the softest hole in the design; this
     closes it.

  4. THE LOG. The SET's `logID` must be `SHA-256(log public key)`, binding the
     entry to the specific log whose key the verifier trusts -- an entry signed
     by a different log cannot be presented under this one's key.

`integratedTime` is then an UPPER bound: the entry existed by that instant. Only
an upper bound can rescue (temporal.binding_trust), which is why this returns it
typed as one.

The checkpoint and SET are Rekor's real formats (Go-sumdb signed note; the
canonical-JSON SET). There is deliberately no home-grown stand-in format in this
module: a verifier that only understood a QKnot-invented note would either
reject real Rekor material or, worse, accept a fabricated note wrapped around a
real root. Tests exercise these SAME real formats with a test key (see
tests/signing/_rekor_doubles.py), so the format the unit tests sign is the format
production verifies.
