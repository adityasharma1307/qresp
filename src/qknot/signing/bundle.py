"""Serialise a hybrid signature as an OMS-compatible Sigstore bundle.

WHERE EVERYTHING GOES, AND WHY THERE WAS NO CHOICE
==================================================
The placements below are not preferences. They are the only positions the OMS
v1.0 schemas permit, established by validating candidates against the published
schemas rather than by reading the prose. See
`tests/signing/test_oms_compatibility.py`, which re-checks each one.

    dsseEnvelope.signatures[]          MULTIPLE ALLOWED -> both signatures
    subject[].digest["sha3-256"]       digest_set is open -> SHA-3 digest
    subject[].algorithmBinding         subject is open -> THE BINDING
    predicate.resources[] extra keys   open -> per-file SHA-3 digests

    signature.algorithm                REFUSED (additionalProperties: false)
    predicate top-level fields         REFUSED
    statement top-level fields         REFUSED
    serialization.hash_type = sha3     REFUSED (enum)

THE CONSEQUENCE WORTH REPORTING
===============================
`signatures` is an array with no maximum, so a hybrid bundle is structurally
valid OMS today. But `signature` is closed to new fields and the spec states
that `keyid` "is not used for verification", so **a conformant OMS bundle can
carry an ML-DSA signature that no verifier can identify**. OMS can carry a
hybrid signature and cannot describe one. That gap is the substance of the
spec proposal in docs/OMS-COMPATIBILITY.md.

WHY THE BINDING GOES IN THE SUBJECT
===================================
It must sit inside the DSSE payload, because the payload is what the signatures
cover. A binding outside it could be edited freely, and the whole
non-separability argument would collapse. `predicate` and the statement root
are both closed, so `subject[]` -- which permits additional properties -- is
the only position that is both schema-valid and signed.

That reasoning is now literally true rather than aspirational: signatures are
computed over the DSSE PAE of this payload (see dsse.py), so everything the
statement carries -- binding, entropy attestation, backend descriptors, notes --
is covered. The payload is therefore emitted verbatim from `signed.payload` and
never rebuilt, since re-serialising it risks a byte difference that would
invalidate a genuine signature.

BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
======================
An unmodified OMS verifier reads this bundle, validates it, finds the Ed25519
signature it understands, and ignores the rest. It gets exactly the protection
it would have had anyway. A QKnot-aware verifier additionally checks the ML-DSA
signature and enforces the binding. Nothing is forked.
