"""Quantum random number generation with attested provenance.

Phase II, Task 4. Supplies entropy for ML-DSA key generation and records where
that entropy actually came from.

WHY THE ATTESTATION IS THE POINT
================================
A key seeded from a quantum source and a key seeded from `os.urandom` are
indistinguishable by inspection. Both are 32 uniform-looking bytes. If the
pipeline silently falls back when the QRNG is unreachable -- which it will,
because it is a free public web service -- then every downstream claim about
quantum entropy becomes unfalsifiable, and a reader has to take the signer's
word for it.

So every call records an `EntropyAttestation`: which backend actually served
the bytes, when, how many, and a commitment to the material. That record is
what lets a verifier distinguish a QRNG-seeded key from a PRNG-fallback key
instead of assuming a provenance that was never established. It becomes a
signed predicate in the Task 5 bundle.

Falling back is not a security failure. ML-DSA's FIPS 204 guarantee rests on
the hardness of Module-LWE, not on the physical origin of the seed, and
`os.urandom` is a CSPRNG seeded from the operating system's entropy pool. The
fallback is a defensible engineering choice; concealing it would not be.

BACKENDS
========
    anu       ANU Quantum Numbers, over HTTPS. Default. See the note below.
    system    os.urandom. Always available, always honest about being classical.
    ibm       IBM Quantum. Documented contract only, not implemented.
    usb       Local USB hardware QRNG. Documented contract only, not implemented.

A NOTE ON THE ANU ENDPOINT
==========================
The project memo specifies ANU as a "public HTTPS API, no auth". That was true
of the original `qrng.anu.edu.au/API/jsonI.php` service, but ANU has since
migrated to `api.quantumnumbers.anu.edu.au`, which requires a free API key, and
describes the unauthenticated endpoint as being phased out. Both are supported
here: the keyed endpoint is used when `ANU_API_KEY` is set, and the legacy one
otherwise, with the deprecation surfaced in the attestation rather than hidden.

This matters beyond configuration. Task 7 requires a Colab notebook that is
"fully reproducible without hardware QRNG access (ANU backend only)". If the
default backend needs a key that the reader does not have, the notebook is not
reproducible by an arbitrary reader. Flagged for a decision rather than
resolved here.
