"""Combine entropy sources instead of choosing between them.

THE PROBLEM WITH CHOOSING
=========================
An earlier design asked "quantum or classical?" and fell back to `os.urandom`
when the QRNG was unreachable. That framing creates a downgrade to agonise
over, an `--on-qrng-failure` policy to configure, and a permanent question of
whether any given key is "really" quantum.

It is also unnecessary. Combining entropy sources with a KDF yields a result at
least as strong as the strongest input, so there is no reason to pick one. This
is what the Linux kernel RNG does, and it dissolves the problem: a run with a
reachable beacon and a run without differ in *what evidence they carry*, not in
whether the key is sound.

SECRET AND PUBLIC INPUTS ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE
================================================
Sources divide into two kinds, and conflating them is catastrophic:

  * **Secret** -- `os.urandom`, ANU, a hardware QRNG. Nobody else sees these
    bytes. They provide unpredictability.
  * **Public** -- the NIST beacon. Everyone sees these bytes. They provide
    verifiability and a timestamp, and *no* unpredictability whatsoever.

Deriving a key from public inputs alone hands that key to anyone who reads the
beacon. `mix_entropy` therefore refuses to produce a seed unless at least one
secret contribution is present. That is a hard error, not a warning, because
the failure is silent and total: the resulting key would look perfectly random
and be entirely predictable.

Public randomness enters as the HKDF **salt**; secret randomness as the input
keying material. RFC 5869 is explicit that the salt need not be secret.

WHAT THE ATTESTATION RECORDS
============================
Every contributing source, its role, whether it was quantum, and a commitment
to what it contributed. For the beacon it also records the pulse index and
signature, so a reader can fetch that exact pulse from NIST and confirm the
salt. That is the difference between a claim and evidence.
