"""One registry for every algorithm this package knows about.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
====================
The question "does this algorithm resist Shor?" was previously answered in
three places that had no reason to agree, and did not:

    combiner.KNOWN_ALGORITHMS    listed slh-dsa-128f and ecdsa-p384
    backends._BACKENDS           implemented neither
    temporal.ALGORITHM_POLICIES  had a policy for slh-dsa-128s but not -128f

So a suite naming `slh-dsa-128f` was accepted by the combiner, rejected by the
backend factory with a bare "unknown algorithm", and reported by the temporal
layer as "standing cannot be assessed" -- three different answers to one
question, none of them wrong on its own terms.

Drift between parallel tables is not a bug you fix once. It is a bug you keep
fixing, unless the tables stop being parallel. Everything below is the single
source; the other modules derive their views from it and cannot disagree.

THE THREE PROPERTIES, WHICH ARE GENUINELY INDEPENDENT
=====================================================
    resists_shor   cryptographic fact about the algorithm
    backend        whether *this package* can compute it
    status/date    a standards-body position, which moves

Conflating the second with the first is how "we don't implement it" quietly
becomes "it isn't safe". They are kept as separate fields so that an algorithm
we cannot compute still gets an honest assessment of its standing.

    `disallowed_after` is a *date*, and the policy it encodes reads "unacceptable
    for new signatures after 2031-12-31" -- meaning the whole of that day is
    still acceptable. `disallowed_after_date` therefore returns the last instant
    of the named day, not its midnight. Comparing against midnight would have
    declared a signature made at noon on the deadline to be past it.

    `regime` names the regulation the date comes from, and it is not
    decoration. There is no single post-quantum deadline: CNSA 2.0 requires
    exclusive post-quantum software signing for national security systems from
    2027-01-01, while OMB M-26-15 -- which states in terms that it "does not
    apply to national security systems" -- puts civilian signature migration at
    2031-12-31, and the NIST IR 8547 *draft* uses 2030 deprecated / 2035
    disallowed. A date recorded without its regime cannot be checked, updated,
    or argued with, and an operator on a different regime cannot tell that the
    number does not apply to them.

    This registry currently encodes **OMB M-26-15**. A national-security
    deployment must substitute CNSA 2.0 dates; see docs/CITATIONS.md 1.
