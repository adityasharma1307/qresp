"""The full registration verification chain: steps 1-8 of the spec, composed.

This ties together proof-of-possession (registration.py), Fulcio chain
verification (fulcio.py), transparency inclusion (rekor.py) and the temporal
decision (temporal.py) into the single verdict the spec's section 4 describes,
and reports WHICH basis it trusted -- direct or rescued-by-timestamp -- rather
than a bare accept.

THE ORDER MATTERS, AND IT IS THE SIGSTORE INSIGHT
=================================================
A Fulcio certificate is short-lived (~10 minutes). Years later it is expired,
so it cannot be validated as-of `now`. It is validated as-of the LOG's
integratedTime `T`: the entry's inclusion proof makes `T` trustworthy, and the
cert was valid then. So inclusion (step 6) runs BEFORE chain validation (step
3), and the chain is checked at `T`. This is exactly how a Sigstore verifier
treats an expired signing cert, and getting the order wrong would reject every
registration older than ten minutes.
