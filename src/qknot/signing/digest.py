"""Content digests for arbitrary artefacts.

SHA-3, NOT SHA-2
================
Grover's algorithm gives a quadratic speed-up on preimage search, halving a
hash's effective preimage security: SHA-256's 256-bit preimage resistance
becomes roughly 128 bits against a quantum adversary. That is not broken, but
it is thinner than it looks for an artefact whose signature is meant to outlive
the transition, and it sits oddly beside an ML-DSA signature chosen for exactly
that horizon.

SHA3-256 has the same nominal output size but a 1600-bit internal state, so its
collision and preimage margins degrade more gracefully under the same
reduction. Choosing SHA-2 alongside a post-quantum signature would make the
hash the weakest link in a chain built to avoid exactly that.

The OMS registry mandates `sha256` and permits `blake2b`/`blake3`; SHA-3 is
absent. We therefore emit *both*: `sha256` for conformance with existing
verifiers, `sha3-256` alongside it. See `bundle.py` for where each lands, and
docs/OMS-COMPATIBILITY.md for the schema constraints that forced that choice.

MULTI-FILE ARTEFACTS
====================
A model is rarely one file. `manifest_digest` builds a canonical manifest of
per-file digests and hashes that, so a repository of a thousand shards reduces
to one value that a signature can cover. Three properties matter:

  * **Order independence.** Entries are sorted by path before hashing, so the
    same tree yields the same digest regardless of filesystem enumeration
    order.
  * **Structure binding.** Each entry is length-prefixed, so a file named
    "a/b" with digest X cannot be confused with a file named "a" containing
    "/b" plus X. Concatenating unprefixed fields is a classic source of
    collision attacks in manifest formats.
  * **Exclusions are part of the digest.** See below. This one was missing and
    was exploitable.

WHY EXCLUDED FILES ARE STILL HASHED INTO THE DIGEST
===================================================
Some paths should not have their *contents* hashed: `.git` is enormous and
irrelevant to a model, `__pycache__` is build output, and a symlink's target may
sit outside the artefact entirely.

An earlier version simply skipped them, which created a hole big enough to walk
through. Because a skipped file left no trace in the manifest, **adding one did
not change the digest**, so a signature over a clean tree kept verifying after
an attacker dropped files into it:

    clean tree              6b3cd61b...
    + __pycache__ payload   6b3cd61b...   unchanged
    + symlink out of tree   6b3cd61b...   unchanged
    + .git/hooks payload    6b3cd61b...   unchanged

`__pycache__` is the dangerous one: CPython loads a `.pyc` whose embedded header
matches its source, so that is an unsigned code-execution path sitting behind a
signature that verifies clean.

The fix is not to hash the contents -- the reasons for skipping them are still
good -- but to make the *skipping itself* visible. Every excluded path is
recorded with its reason (and, for a symlink, its target) and hashed into the
manifest digest. Adding a file under `__pycache__` now changes the exclusion
list, which changes the digest, which invalidates every signature. The contents
are still never read.

Exclusions are hashed under their own domain tag so an excluded path can never
be confused with an included one carrying a coincidentally equal digest.

Nothing here is specific to machine learning. It hashes bytes and trees of
bytes.
