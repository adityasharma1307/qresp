"""`qknot register`: the eight-step orchestrator that produces a bundle.

Thin by design. It COMPOSES the sealed pieces -- `sign_hybrid_registration`,
`rekord_preimage`, `log_entry_from_rekor`, `verify_registration_chain` -- and
reimplements none of the checkpoint / SET / chain math. The two network
operations (get a Fulcio certificate, submit to Rekor) live behind a Protocol
seam, so the orchestration is pure, offline-testable logic: a real deployment
injects vetted Sigstore clients; tests inject fakes that mint the same trust
stack the rest of the suite uses.

The eight steps (spec section 7):

  1. hold/generate the classical P-256 key -- the deprecating anchor. It is
     ephemeral, exactly like Fulcio's own signing key: its job is to be
     certified and to sign this one registration.
  2. get a Fulcio certificate over it (FulcioClient; does OIDC internally).
  3. hold the long-term PQC key -- the caller's, and the thing being registered.
  4. build the dual-signed hybrid registration, with identity and issuer taken
     FROM the certificate, never free-typed, so the payload cannot claim an
     identity the cert does not attest.
  5. submit a hashedrekord: digest = rekord_preimage(...), signature = the
     classical DSSE signature (RekorClient).
  6. fetch the inclusion proof + checkpoint + SET (the client's response).
  7. map that response into a LogEntry with the shared mapper (both indices).
  8. assemble the RegistrationBundle and -- MANDATORY -- verify it end to end
     before returning. A registration that logs but does not verify is a
     failure, not a success; the same-process check is what keeps `register`
     honest and stops residual-3 work from silently reopening residuals 1 or 2.
