"""QKnot command-line interface.

Two halves, and the commands mirror them.

RESPOND -- sign an artefact so the post-quantum half cannot be stripped, bind
the post-quantum key to an identity through classical PKI, and verify both
together:

  qknot sign ./my-model --out model.bundle.json --context model-release
  qknot trust-material --out ./trust                   # once, or when it goes stale
  qknot register --out ./my-registration \
                 --fulcio-roots ./trust/fulcio_roots.pem --log-key ./trust/rekor.pub
  qknot verify ./my-model --bundle model.bundle.json --context model-release \
               --registration ./my-registration/bundle.json \
               --fulcio-roots ./trust/fulcio_roots.pem --log-key ./trust/rekor.pub

The last one is the point of the whole design: it reports not merely that a
signature is valid, but WHOSE it is and on what basis that attribution still
holds -- `direct`, or `rescued-by-timestamp` once the classical algorithm has
been disallowed.

MEASURE an ecosystem -- how much is signed, and would any of it survive a
quantum adversary. The evidence for why RESPOND exists:

  qknot scan --n 1000 --out data/hf.jsonl --token $HF_TOKEN
  qknot audit-npm  --ranking data/npm_ranking.json --frame data/npm_frame.txt \
                   --out data/npm.jsonl
  qknot audit-pypi --out data/pypi.jsonl
  qknot summarise  --in data/hf.jsonl

    the other attesting to its absence. The obvious hybrid -- two independent
