"""Classify one npm package's attestation state.

Emits the same `SigAlgorithm`/`QLabel` vocabulary as the HuggingFace and PyPI
audits, so `stats.py` treats all three ecosystems identically. Three outcomes,
never two: unattested, attested, and could-not-check.

WHAT MAKES npm DIFFERENT FROM PyPI HERE
=======================================
A version can carry two attestations. Only the SLSA provenance one embeds a
certificate whose algorithm can be read; npm's own publish attestation
references a key by ID.

The record therefore reports both: `sig_algorithm` describes the provenance
attestation, and `predicate_types` lists everything present. A package with
*only* npm's publish attestation is genuinely attested but not
algorithm-classifiable from the bundle alone, and is recorded as exactly that
rather than as unsigned or as classical.
