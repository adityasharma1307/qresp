"""What the environment running a scan could and could not have detected.

WHY A SCAN MUST RECORD THIS ABOUT ITSELF
========================================
The study reports that no post-quantum signatures were found. Whether that
sentence is about the ecosystems or about the scanner depends entirely on
whether the scanner's X.509 stack could parse a post-quantum certificate --
and that is a property of the environment, not of this repository.

`cryptography` added ML-DSA certificate loading in 2026, gated on OpenSSL 3.5.0
or later. Its own release notes add that because it ships wheels with a bundled
OpenSSL, most users will not have the APIs even after upgrading. Measured here:
cryptography 48.0.0 linked against **OpenSSL 4.0.0** still exposes no
`asymmetric.ml_dsa` module. The OpenSSL version is necessary and not
sufficient; how the wheel was built decides it.

So "could this run have seen an ML-DSA certificate?" has a different answer on
different machines, on the same day, with the same requirements file. A scan
that does not record its own answer cannot support a negative result later --
the reader is asked to trust that the detector worked, which is exactly what
this project refuses to do anywhere else.

This module answers it, and `scan_environment()` goes into every manifest.
