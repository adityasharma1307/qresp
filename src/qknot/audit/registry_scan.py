"""Two-stratum registry scans: the orchestration behind the npm and PyPI audits.

The npm and PyPI runners were two ~220-line scripts whose bodies were nearly
identical -- same strata, same seeded sampling, same manifest, same resume rule,
same thread pool, same progress reporting, and a `already_done` docstring
duplicated word for word. Only the source of the ranking and the frame really
differed. That is one procedure with two inputs, so it lives here once, and both
the scripts and `qknot audit-npm` / `qknot audit-pypi` call it.

THE METHODOLOGY THIS ENCODES
============================
* **Two strata.** `head` is the top N by downloads; `tail` is N sampled at
  random from everything else. Reporting only the head would describe the
  popular packages and call it the ecosystem.
* **The sample is re-derivable, not merely described.** The seed, the frame
  size and a SHA-256 of the frame go into a manifest beside the output, so the
  tail can be reconstructed rather than taken on trust.
* **Resumable, because a 20,000-project scan over a public API WILL be
  interrupted.** A collector that treats an interruption as fatal is one that
  never finishes.
* **`error` is not `unsigned`.** A project that could not be reached was not
  checked, and counting it as unsigned would inflate the very number the study
  reports. Error rows are therefore NOT treated as done on resume: re-running
  retries them, and the reader takes the latest record per project. This is the
  absent-versus-unchecked rule the whole project is built on, one level up.
