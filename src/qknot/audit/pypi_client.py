"""PyPI access for the multi-ecosystem attestation audit.

WHAT MADE THIS CHEAPER THAN PLANNED
===================================
The task memo assumed attestation presence would be checked per package via
PyPI's Integrity API. It does not have to be. The **Simple API in JSON form**
(PEP 691, `Accept: application/vnd.pypi.simple.v1+json`) returns every file a
project has ever published, each with a `provenance` field that is a URL when
that file carries a PEP 740 attestation and null when it does not.

So "has this project ever attested any release?" is **one request per project**,
not one per release per file. For a 20,000-project sample that is 20,000
requests rather than millions, and the Integrity API is needed only when the
attestation's *contents* matter -- which they do, but only for the small
attested minority.

CLASSIFYING THE ALGORITHM, RATHER THAN ASSUMING IT
==================================================
A provenance document embeds the Fulcio certificate that signed the
attestation, so the signing algorithm can be read off the certificate's public
key. That matters: the HuggingFace study's headline is that **zero** signed
repositories used a post-quantum algorithm, and repeating that claim for PyPI
on the grounds that "PyPI uses Sigstore and Sigstore is classical" would be an
inference, not a measurement. Reading the key type from each certificate makes
it the latter, and leaves room for the answer to be surprising.
