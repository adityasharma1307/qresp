"""npm registry access for the multi-ecosystem attestation audit.

PROBED AGAINST THE LIVE REGISTRY, 2026-07-30
============================================
npm turned out to mirror PyPI closely, which was not obvious in advance:

* **Presence is one request per package.** The abbreviated packument
  (`Accept: application/vnd.npm.install-v1+json`) returns every version with a
  `dist.attestations` field present or absent. No per-version fetching.
* **Scoped packages work** with `%2f` encoding.
* **The algorithm is readable from a certificate**, exactly as on PyPI.

TWO ATTESTATIONS PER VERSION, AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME THING
=============================================================
`/-/npm/v1/attestations/{pkg}@{version}` returns two:

| predicateType | verification material |
|---|---|
| `github.com/npm/attestation/.../publish/v0.1` | `publicKey` -- npm's own registry key, **by reference** |
| `slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2` or `/v1` | `certificate` -- a **Fulcio** certificate |

Only the SLSA one embeds a certificate, so only it can have its algorithm read
off directly. The npm publish attestation names a key by ID, and resolving that
ID needs npm's published key set.

This module classifies the **provenance** attestation and records the presence
of the publish one separately. Folding them together would double-count a
single publishing event as two signatures; ignoring the publish attestation
entirely would undercount what npm actually signs. Neither is acceptable
silently, so both are reported.

WHY RANKING NEEDS TWO STAGES
============================
npm publishes no downloads ranking. The bulk downloads endpoint takes 128
packages per request, so ranking a ~3.5M frame is ~27,000 requests -- about 23
minutes at the rate this project sustains elsewhere, which is affordable.

**The obstacle is not volume. It is that the bulk endpoint rejects scoped
packages.** Scoped names must be queried one at a time, and `@babel/*`,
`@types/*` and similar are a large share of the most-depended-on packages, so
excluding them would bias the head stratum towards unscoped names rather than
towards popular ones.

Hence: a candidate pool first (which may come from any popularity-ish source,
since it only has to avoid *losing* packages), then real download counts over
that pool -- bulk for unscoped, individually for scoped.
