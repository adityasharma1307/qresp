"""HuggingFace API client.

Thin wrapper around the `huggingface_hub` Python library that adds:
  * exponential-backoff retries on transient failures
  * a small abstraction (`HfClient`) that can be swapped for a fixture-backed
    client during tests, so the scanner does not require network access in CI.

The wrapper exposes only the two operations the scanner needs:
  1. list_top_models(n)            -> iterable of model summary records
  2. fetch_signature_files(repo)   -> iterable of (filename, bytes)
